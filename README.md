## How do you do this?
Facial recognition
### How does it work?
(Start with camera_new.py)
1. Put your image in . /face_recognize/goodImage
2. use getImage to determine if the image is correct
3. the intruder's image will be displayed in . /Intruder.

You can use Windows Task Scheduler to start it silently.

but I don't know how to create a Windows task scheduler.

## Note
The "getImage" folder is empty after each judgment.

The environment may not easy to create.
